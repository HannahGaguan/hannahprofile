    <h1>DISLIKES</h1>
    <p> Here are the attitudes and things I hated the most. I have Hemophobia or fear of own blood, I fainted sometimes
        but I'm trying to conquer it. It's wierd because I'm unsual like not like every girls who are scared of insects,rodents
        snakes and hieghts. I also hate ginamos for no reason I don't even know why. And also hate toxic trait and fake people,
        I used to avoid them and sometimes I get peevish when they act beyond my patience.
