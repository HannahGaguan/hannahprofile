    <h1>LIKES</h1>
    <p> Since my father works on a ranch since then till now I really loved horses and countrysides.
         Because it makes me calm,fresh, relaxed and stress-free. My best favorites are corn,watermelon,nuts,chocolates,
         chips or anthing that is sweet and spicy. I loved eating them when I'm stress or frustrated. I also loved adventures,
         things that exicites me or explore new things outside my comfortzone.
